# CIS\*4020 Dashboard

An R Shiny dashboard for CIS\*4020, used to provide a tool for the veterinarians in New York to analyze\
the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance, and determine the best treatment options for canines and felines,\
potentially reducing the need for expensive susceptibility testing.

The dashboard is hosted on [shinyapps.io](https://anthonydip.shinyapps.io/CIS4020-Dashboard/).

Note: The computations for the dashboard in the server takes around 1-2 minutes to complete. No information will be displayed until they are finished.
