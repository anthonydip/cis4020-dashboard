              <p>To determine the total number of CANINE and FELINE within the testing data that was used, add up the values in their respective columns.</p>
              <p>Here is some insight on how the interpret these values:</p>
              <p><b>Confusion Matrix: </b>The two rows represent the CANINE/FELINE predictions from the trained SVM model. The two columns represent the actual number of CANINE/FELINE in the testing data. For example, the top-left value shows the amount of times the model predicted CANINE and the actual testing data was CANINE. On the other hand, for the top-right value, it shows the amount of times the model predicted CANINE but the actual testing data was FELINE. If the row and column name are the same (e.g. CANINE-CANINE or FELINE-FELINE), the value in that cell indicates how many predictions the model got correct.</p>
              <p><b>Accuracy: </b>This value represents the overall accuracy of the model in correctly predicting CANINE or FELINE</p>
              <p><b>Kappa: </b>Measures the agreement between classification and truth values. A value closer to 1 indicates good agreement, while a value closer to 0 indicates no agreement.</p>
              <p><b>Sensitivity: </b>The proportion of actual positives (canines) that were correctly identified by the model</p>
              <p><b>Specificity: </b>The proportion of actual negatives (felines) that were correctly identified by the model</p>
              <p><b>Prevalence: </b>The prevalence/proportion of CANINE within the testing data</p>
              <p><b>Balanced Accuracy: </b>The determined average of sensitivity and specificity. May be useful for imbalanced datasets</p>
              <br/>
              <p><b>Confusion Matrix and Statistics Conclusion</b></p>
              <p>After multiple runs of training and testing the SVM model, we have come to the same conclusion every time when analyzing the confusion matrix and statistics.</p>
              <p>The model always results in high sensitivity and very low specificity, indicating it performs well in identifying canine cases but poorly in identifying feline cases. This could be due to a fairly large amount of canine infections compared to feline infections within the original dataset. This may result in a higher prevalence of canines within the training data, resulting in more canine predictions within the testing data.</p>
              <p>Overall, based on the results from the confusion matrix and generated statistics, there might be a slight indication of differences between canines and felines while looking at their susceptibility test results. However, due to a few possible limitations (e.g., proportion of canines vs felines, insufficient features, etc), there can be no definitive conclusion based solely on the antimicrobial resistance patterns.</p>

Therefore, the t-SNE method had to be applied, which is a non-linear dimensionality reduction technique, allowing the high-dimensional data to be reduced into just 2 dimensions for visualization.</p>

              <p><b>Scatter Plot Conclusion</b></p>
              <p>When observing the graph after multiple iterations of training and testing, we can always see numerous groups of points, scattered around the graph.</p>

As the dimensionality has been reduced using t-SNE, there can be no direct interpretation of what these groups of clusters and their location on the graph could mean. However, a possibility for a cluster of points could indicate similar antimicrobial resistance patterns based on their susceptibility test results. As these clusters include both canine and feline species, it could represent similarities in AMR patterns in canines and felines.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, based on the results of both the confusion matrix and scatter plot, there is <b>no clear distinction</b> between antimicrobial resistance patterns found in canine and feline bladder infections within New York.</p>

              <p><b>Histogram Conclusion</b></p>
              <p>Based on the histogram above and observed probabilities, it is evident that the most frequent probability is within the range of 0.36, showing around 5000 occurrences. We can see that a significantly large amount of the probabilities occur under the 0.4 range, showing a large bias towards CANINE classification.</p>
              <p>From the results of the model, it appears that based on solely the susceptibility tests, the probability that our response variable (species in this case) takes on the value CANINE is more prevalent.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, this could indicate slight differences between the antimicrobial patterns between canines and felines, perhaps canines showing more distinct patterns. However, this could also be due to the existence of more canine infections within the dataset.</p>
