          <h2>Antimicrobial Resistance in New York</h2>
          <hr/>
          <h4><b>Authors</b></h4>
          <p>Anthony Dip, Branden Phan, Michael Lam</p>

          <h4><b>The Problem</b></h4>
          <p>As the implications of antimicrobial resistance found within bacteria are on the rise, it becomes increasingly difficult and expensive to correctly treat various infections.</p>
          <p>Due to antimicrobial susceptibility testing becoming more costly, treatment choices often rely on past success, recommendations from senior veterinarians, and antimicrobial stewardship guidelines.</p>
          <p>In order to combat the persistence of antimicrobial resistance, it is crucial that veterinarians utilize precise antimicrobial treatment decisions.</p>
          <p>We aim to provide veterinarians a tool based on previous susceptibility tests, allowing for data-driven decisions, potentially reducing the need for further testing.</p>
          <br/>
          <h4><b>Questions to Be Answered</b></h4>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Do antimicrobial resistance patterns differ between canine and feline bladder infections within New York?</b></li>
            <br/>
            <li><b>Do the types of antibiotic-resistant bacteria commonly found in canines and felines differ between urban and rural regions?</b></li>
            <br/>
            <li><b>What antimicrobial bacteria is most common in canines and felines within New York?</b></li>
          </ul>
          <br/>
          <p>As the large dataset utilized within this application is solely based on infections observed in canines and felines within New York state, this tool is directed towards veterinarians based in New York.</p>
